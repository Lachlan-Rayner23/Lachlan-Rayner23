Hi, my name is Lachlan Rayner.

I am a student currently studying towards a bachelor of Computer Science at RMIT University. I am interested in all things related to computers however I mainly enjoy learning about networks and cybersecurity.
Through my studies I aim to secure myself a future in the field of cybersecurity with an extensive knowledge of the functioning of networks and computer systems.
In my final two years of high school I took up a VET course and earned my Cert III in networking and cybersecurity alongside my usual studies, giving me experience with networks and knowledge of how to use a variety of tools to perform penetration testing.

I aim to use this GitHub page as a means of cataloguing various projects and other things I may work on alongside or as a part of my studies at University.
